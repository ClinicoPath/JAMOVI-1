# JAMOVI

## Summary

1. Developed all classification models for JAMOVI(open-source Statistical tool) for people with a non-statistical background.
2. Build a Decision Tree and Random Forest machine learning algorithm module for JAMOVI open-source statistical tool.
3. Gave options to normalize the data variable before applying the algorithm to increase the model efficiency.
4. Provided output information such as Predicted test output along with the actual value and evaluation metrics to validate the fit of the model.
